[h1]Pick Up At Home (1.6 Update)[/h1]
This is a [b]reimplementation[/b] of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982694750]original "Pick Up At Home" mod[/url] for RimWorld, updated to support [b]version 1.6[/b].

In RimWorld 1.5, the original mod added a Float Menu option via [b]Harmony patching[/b], allowing pawns to manually pick up items within player-controlled home maps.
However, as of RimWorld 1.6, this functionality can now be added using the [b]native `[u]FloatMenuOptionProvider[/u]` system[/b], which this mod takes full advantage of.

‚ö†Ô∏è Version 1.5 still requires Harmony!

[*] Allows selected pawns to [b]manually pick up items[/b] into their inventory.
[*] Takes into account: 
[list]

[h2]üì¶ Differences from the Original Mod[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]No Harmony patching[/b] is used ‚Äî all functionality is built using RimWorld 1.6's [b]native modding API[/b].
[*] Refactored and cleaned up logic for better compatibility with the new FloatMenu system.
[*] Fully compatible with other FloatMenuOptionProviders in 1.6.
[/list]

[h2]üìå Notes[/h2]
[list]
[*] This is [b]not an official update[/b] by the original author.
[*] This version was rebuilt by reviewing and understanding the original mod‚Äôs functionality, then adapting it using new 1.6 tools.
[*] The mod should be safe to use in existing saves, but always back up your game just in case.
